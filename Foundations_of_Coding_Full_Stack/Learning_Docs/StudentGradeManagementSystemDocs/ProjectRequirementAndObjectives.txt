Functional Requirements -

Add new students by entering Name and unique Student ID.

Store student information (ID, Name, and list of grades).

Assign grades for multiple subjects for each student.

Allow updating or adding more grades to an existing student.

Calculate and display the average grade of a student.

Display full student records, including ID, Name, subjects with grades, and average.

Basic menu-driven console interaction (for adding students, adding grades, viewing records, etc.).

________________________________________________

Non-Functional Requirements -

The application will be a C# console-based program.

Data will be temporary and stored in memory (no database needed for this project).

Input should be validated (e.g., prevent duplicate IDs, handle invalid grade input).

The program should be simple, user-friendly, and easy to navigate using console menus.

The code should be modular, using functions or methods for major operations (like AddStudent, CalculateAverage, DisplayRecords).

Application should handle errors gracefully without crashing (for example, if user enters a wrong ID).

Project Objectives -

Build a working C# console application that can manage students and their grades.

Provide functionality for users to add students, assign grades, and view results.

Show an accurate calculation of each studentâ€™s average grade.

Demonstrate understanding of C# fundamentals such as data structures (lists/dictionaries), classes, methods, and console input/output.

Deliver a clean, menu-based interface that makes it easy to use the system.
